# FreeBSD: Wanted Ports
Unofficial repository to share list of wanted ports for FreeBSD (not only ZRouter/MIPS/Embedded)

Official list of wanted ports is here: https://wiki.freebsd.org/WantedPorts
But if you have no wiki account, you can't publish any request there. 

You can use email lists with hope that ports committers/porters will see it. 

This repository is yet another hope to raise request for porting of software. To raise request, please create new issue with title like "[category/portname] new port of awesome software" or "[category/portname] update port to version X.Y". 

Shortly speaking, this repo will allow us to understand list of missing tools and communicate with you (requestors).
